#My first steps with GPIO

fun_with_LEDs.py is the example script from geekpub

ampel_LED.py is a simple script that goes through all LEDs (red, yellow, green) in the sequence of a traffic light

light_show randomly selects one of the three LEDs and turns them off or on, depending on whether they are
currently off or on..
